## Overview

I am an academic Research Fellow at BehaviourWorks Australia, a research enterprise that's part of the Monash Sustainable Development Institute at Monash University. We conduct applied behaviour science research focusing on behaviour change. I work with various Australian state and federal government departments and other organisations to understand and solve problems using behaviour science.

As part of the Institute, I apply behaviour science methods to grapple with complex and seemingly intractable challenges of transitioning to sustainable systems. This work is framed by the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

I come from a disciplinary foundation of social psychology focused on **intergroup conflict, cooperation and coordination**. During my PhD, the reproducibility crisis in psychology blossomed and I became interested in **open and reproducible methods in science**. In my postdoc at UNSW, I learned the importance of **implementation science** in the success of medical, policy and other interventions.

A lot of the work I do day-to-day focuses on **individual behaviour change** using a mix of methods and theories from psychology, economics, environmental management, and public administration. Right now I am working to learn more about **institutional and process design, collaboration and collective decision-making** and **behaviour change for system transitions and transformations** as I believe this is where I can have the most marginal impact in the next 10 years.

## Previous research

### Collective action

As part of my PhD work (2011-2015), I investigated collective action, where people come together to create social change. When I started, psychologists had worked from a simple model of advantaged groups vs. disadvantaged groups - a two-group system. But there are almost always more than two groups involved in intergroup conflict. Psychological theories of collective action focused on social connection ("social identity"), a sense of shared anger, and a belief that taking action could make a difference. 

My PhD work extended these theories to consider ideologies such as Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism and valuing change and the status quo as new predictors for action, and also considered a novel third party group I labelled as "outsiders". This led to a greater understanding about how people outside the two groups locked in a struggle might view the conflict, what psychological processes might lead them to "side" with different groups in conflict, and the form outsiders' action might take.

### Socialisation and privacy protection on social media

People claim to value their privacy, yet frequently disclose personal information on publically or semi-publically accessible social network services like Facebook. For my honours thesis in 2010, I investigated the possible role of group norms alongside perceptions of risk and trust in influencing Facebook users’ privacy protection intentions and behaviour. We found that injunctive social norms (what others think you should do), descriptive social norms (what others actually do), and perceived risk each independently influenced people's willingness to protect their privacy on Facebook

Much has been written on the alleged insufficiency of Facebook and other social media to provide a truly authentic social experience that meets the needs of its users. In 2012, I collaborated on a project led by Stephanie Tobin to investigate how and when using Facebook can satisfy basic psychological needs of belonging. After a two-day intervention, people who were asked to "lurk"—to only watch others participate socially on Facebook—felt as though they belonged less and perceived a less meaningful existence compared with people who participated as normal. This effect extended to a brief laboratory study in which people who did not receive feedback on a Facebook post they reported lower satisfaction of their basic psychological needs.
