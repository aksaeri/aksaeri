Iâ€™m a first-generation Australian of Indonesian, Dutch, and Kiwi (Scottish) descent, born and raised in Brisbane.

I received a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Hons I) from The University of Queensland (UQ) in 2010 and completed my PhD in 2015 with Aarti Iyer and Winnifred Louis, also at UQ. I've just finished coordinating and lecturing a fourth/honours year course, Current Issues in Psychology II.

In 2016, I worked with Dr Tegan Cruwys to investigate social risk factors for and buffers against depression in large-scale longitudinal datasets, and with Dr Nik Steffens to explore how perceptions of others' commitment to our work teams can influence our own commitment, as well as cooperation, engagement, and performance of the group as a whole.

My interest in group processes stems from a more general fascination with complex phenomena. How do we, as individuals, synthesise the blooming, buzzing confusion that is our continuous experience of the world into beliefs, identities, and behaviours? This general fascination also underpins my love of politics and policy, models and statistics, and the philosophy of science.
