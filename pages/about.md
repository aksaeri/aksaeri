# About me

![Alexander K Saeri](./assets/alexander_k_saeri_300px_2015.jpg)

I'm a first-generation Australian of Indonesian, Dutch, and Kiwi (Scottish) descent, born and raised in Brisbane.

I completed my Bachelor of Psychological Science and PhD from The University of Queensland (UQ) and now live in Sydney. 

I work with BehaviourWorks Australia, part of the Monash Sustainable Development Institute at Monash University.

My interest in group processes stems from a more general fascination with complex phenomena. How do we, as individuals, synthesise the blooming, buzzing confusion that is our continuous experience of the world into beliefs, identities, and behaviours? This general fascination also underpins my love of politics and policy, models and statistics, and the philosophy of science.
